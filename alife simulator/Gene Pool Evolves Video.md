"In the case of gene pool, it goes beyond a hypothesis. It's actually the data. **It's actually how evolution happened.**" - Luka Negoita, Ph.D., Ecologist, Charles Darwin Foundation

"Beautiful self-organization, replication, and even the mysteries of how the first cells began." - Todd Plumer, Ph.D. Scientist, teacher, naturalist


Jeffrey Ventrella - creator of Gene Pool
* How did the world come to have so much biodiversity?
* What is it about our planetary ecosystem that allows so many species to co-exist at the same time in the same common environment over long periods of time?
* Part 1 - Beginnings
	* He was exploring genetic algorithms
		* As a way to simulate the evolution of morphology and motion control
	* Is there a way to model the **evolutionary dynamics** that allows these strategies for locomotion to emerge?
		* Decided to put 100s of these creatures in the same environment and **let evolution unfold naturally**
	* Use of genetics or modelling genetics in virtual creatures was still a new thing
	* Proposed at Rocket Science games
		* Brings on another programmer and creates Darwin Pond (that was a success but marketing was a bit skeptical of due to not knowing how to market a simulation as a game)
* Part 2 - Luka Evolves
	* Luka lives and works in the Galapagos Islands
	* Ran Darwin Pond in 1998 when he was 11/12 and tried to evolve his "master swimmer"
		* Can see DNA code but didn't really understand it
		* Knew that there had to be a way to see how organisms were evolving by looking at their DNA
	* Got really excited about evolutionary biology even though he didn't know the term at the time
	* In 1998, Gene Pool was released taking heavy inspiration from Darwin Pond
* Part 3 - What is a swimbot?
	* a 2-D creature
	* made out of parts
		* different shapes
		* different sizes
		* different colors
	* the parts are constantly moving
		* constantly rotating against each other using sine wave functions with various frequencies, amplitudes, and phases
	* Huge variety of body types and motions
		* Lots of potential for many different swimming strategies
	* Movement follows the kind of motion required for a canoe
	* Genes determine the bots color, order, and movements
	* Begins w/ 100s of the bots in the pool, initialized randomly
	* Swimbots are constantly burning off energy and need to eat the green dots to survive

		Each swimbot has a heading, so it can tell its direction to a foot bit
	* "Swimbots lead very simple lives. They are either interested in food or, if they're not hungry, they are interested in sex."
	* Some swimbots are lucky and manage to get food through their initial flailing and then reproduce creating an offspring
		* offspring inherits the lucky genes
	* **"the spread of genetics is correlated with the ability to reach a goal"**
	* In 2020, Luka and Jeffrey began collaborating together.
* Part 4 - Species coexistence
	* Eels are so efficient that they quickly take over the pond
		* Ones that are just like one singular strand of worm rather than multiple strands
	* Niches
		* One species competes w/ itself for the same food
		* While another species may compete w/ itself for an entirely different food
	* Speciation
		* Initially, all swimbots could breed together
		* About half of the swimbots genes account for the phenotype, then the rest are all 0s, which can get mutated in further generations when bred with other species of swimbots (as can the phenotype genes)
		* Once two swimbots pass a certain threshold in dissimilarity they can no longer breed and are considered distinct species
	* Swimbot populations can now speciate. And with different food niches, these species can coexist.
	* Phylogenetic trees
		* What if we could plot that evolutionary divergence between the different species?
			* We can't get DNA from all the real species that have gone extinct
			* Unlike the real world, in Gene Pool we have all this evolutionary data over time
* Part 5 - Experiencing evolution
	* "Human beings have many, many genes in common with something as weird as a nematode worm. 60-70% of our genes are the same." - Todd Plumer
	* A sense of sentience from what the worms are trying to do
		* This connection of sentience is good in the way that it can inspire us to grok "this unfolding drama of evolution in a deeper way"
	* "We're all just little wiggling bots in a way trying to make some kind of connection with somebody and it's that connection that is to me the beautiful part of being alive." - Todd Plumer
	* Gene Pool offers a great environment for coming up w/ hypotheses and testing them
		* Gives the ability to extract and synthesize the data in real-time while being able to visually examine evolution as it happens before your eyes, where you wouldn't be able to do that in real life
