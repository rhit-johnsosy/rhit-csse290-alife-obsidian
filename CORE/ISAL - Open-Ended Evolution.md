* Reason why studying OEE in ALife
	* Because the notion that life has evolved in an open-ended way
* OEE describes an evolving system that will never settle into a single stable equilibrium

Approaches to filtering out noise:
* Shadow runs
	* Pairing each run of an OEE system with a run in which adaptive systems have been eliminated (the shadow run). Then subtracting the metrics from the shadow run in the non-shadow run. 
* Persistence filtering
	* Predetermine a number of generations in an ancestry tree required for an organism to be deemed important

Measuring OEE:
* Evolutionary activity statistics
	* Measures novelty, diversity, and total evolutionary activity.
* MODES
	* Measures change, novelty, diversity, and complexity.

Hypothesized conditions for OEE:
1. Unlimited genetic space of potential genotypes
2. Mutational pathways with unlimited length between potential phenotypes
3. Dynamic adaptive landscape for continual evolution
