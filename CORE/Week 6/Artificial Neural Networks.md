* Five things to know about neural networks 
	* 1. Neural networks are composed of node layers
		* input node layer
		* hidden layer
		* output layer
		* neural networks reflect the behavior of the human brain
			* allows computer programs to recognize patterns and solve common problems in AI and deep learning
	* 2. Use a linear regression model
		* think of each node as it's own linear regression model
		* connections between the models determines how much influence each input has on the output
		* each node composed of 
			* input data
			* weights
			* bias or a threshold
			* output
		* data is passed from one layer of the neural network to the next in what is known as a feed forward network 
	* 3. Data is passed between nodes feed forward
	* 4. Neural networks rely on training data to learn and improve their accuracy over time.
	* 5. Neural networks have multiple types 
		* convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
			* has a unique architecture which is well-suited for identifying patterns like image recognition
		* recurrent neural networks (RNNs) 
			* identified by their feedback loops
			* primarily leveraged using time series data to make predictions about future events like sales forecasting
