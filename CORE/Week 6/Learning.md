* habituation and sensitization are the two key forms non-associative learning
	* reason why: does not contain any reinforcement or punishment

* Behavior is an aspect of human and animal life
	* Why do we act the way we do? Psychologists have come up with Operant and Classical Conditioning
* Classical Conditioning
	* type of learning that links a neural stimulus with a response
	* Ex: the classic dog, bell, food example
	* another definition: training the brain to connect two things that may not naturally be linked
	* learning to expect something based on previous experiences
* Operant Conditioning 
	* associating behavior with consequences
	* ex:
		* good grades, might get praise or rewards
		* break a rule, might get punished
	* strengthened or weakened by the consequences
	* like a cause-and-effect relationship
* Key differences
	* Focus on stimulus and response:
		* classical: involves associating a neutral stimulus with a response
		* operant: focuses on the relationship between behavior and consequences
	* Learning process:
		* classical: learning by association
		* operant: learning by reinforcement or punishment
	* Voluntary vs. involuntary:
		* classical: often involuntary responses
		* operant: involves voluntary behaviors
	* Timing of stimulus and response:
		* classical: the stimulus comes before the response
		* operant: the consequence comes after the behavior
* Real-world examples
	* classical
		* hungry (response) when you smell your favorite food (stimulus)
	* operant
		* study hard (behavior) to get good grades (reward)
		* refrain from texting in class (behavior) to avoid detention (punishment
* These are crucial because they help explain why we behave the way we do and can be a powerful tool
* classical
	* stimuli w/ responses
* operant
	* behaviors w/ consequences
