"A permanent state is reached, in which no observable events occur.  
The physicist calls this the state of thermodynamical equili-brium, or of ‘maximum entropy’. :"

"van ’t Hoff’s law, men-  
tioned on p. 69: the higher temperature itself speeds up the chemical  
reactions involved in living. (That it actually does, has been con-  
firmed experimentally in species which take the temperature of the  
surrounding.)" pg. 80

"The unfolding of events in the life cycle of an organism exhibits  
an admirable regularity and orderliness, unrivalled by anything  
we meet with in inanimate matter." pg. 82

"it [law of entropy] is nothing but molecular disorder itself" pg. 85

"It appears that there are two different ‘mechanisms’ by which orderly events can be produced: the ‘statistical mechanism’ which produces ‘order from disorder’ and the new one, producing ‘order from order’." pg. 85

"  
it must  
not be believed that the driving mechanism really does away  
with the statistical nature of the process." pg. 88
