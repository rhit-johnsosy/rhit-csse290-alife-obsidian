A cellular automaton (_automata_Â is plural), is a function that takes in a set of cells on a grid, and performs some simple computations to produce a new grid of cells. 
* An ECA is a specific type of cellular automata, one that only exists in one dimension, with cells that have two possible states (dead or alive).

"Whilst researching the ECA, Stephen Wolfram came up with 4 different classes that can categorize them:

- Class 1 - Uniformity
- Class 2 - Repetition
- Class 3 - Randomness
- Class 4 - Complex
