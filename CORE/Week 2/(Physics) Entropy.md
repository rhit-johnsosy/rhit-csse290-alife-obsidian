* "You might also have heard the phrase, "*entropy always increases*". In other words, things are only allowed to happen in one direction -- the direction in which entropy increases."

* "entropy is just a fancy word for ‘number of possible arrangements’. Entropy is a count of how many ways you can rearrange the ‘insides’ of a thing (its microscopic internals), while keeping its ‘outwardly’ (macroscopic) state unchanged."



"So although the sheep are shuffled at random, over time, a pattern emerges. _Some states are more likely than others._"

* "Higher entropy states are more probable than lower entropy ones."
* "So when we look at really tiny solids, energy doesn’t always flow from a hot object to a cold one. It can go the other way sometimes. And entropy doesn’t always increase. This isn't just a theoretical issue, entropy decreases have actually been [seen in microscopic experiments](http://www.nature.com/news/1998/020722/full/news020722-2.html)."
