an interactive introduction to ATTRACTOR LANDSCAPES

Why do many complex systems seem stuck when trying to change them? Why do they seem to cascade all at once when change does come?
* Attractor landscapes can help us understand this
	* Less fancy words: "a ball running down some hills"

Fish example:
* 100 fish max in population
* Below 30, underpopulated, can't reproduce fast enough, fish population goes to 0
* Above 70, overpopulated, fish die off and return to sustainable 70
* Above 30 and below 70, population goes to sustainable 70
* "Population=0 and Population=70 are called **attractors**: because they "attract" the system to it"
* "Population=30 is called a **repeller**, because if the population is slightly below or above 30, it's "repelled" away from 30. Population=30 is also called a **tipping point** because that's where the ecosystem "tips" from the Population=70 attractor to the Population=0 attractor."

"So, the next time you're wondering why things are stuck a certain way, think about:

- What are the "attractors" of this system?
- How "deep" are the valleys? (deeper = harder to escape)
- How "wide" are the valleys? (wider = bigger range of attraction)
- Can we not just move the ball, but _move the hills?_ (changing the underlying system)"
