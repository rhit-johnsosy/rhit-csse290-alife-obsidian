*Note: This would be in reference the Tuesday of Week 3's class* 
What did you learn from the other student presentations on the Week 2 topic?

* I liked the example Dominic brought up from his reading about how fireflies in a country near Vietnam coordinating between one another and synchronizing their time of lighting up as an example of synchronization in dynamical systems and helped me better understand that term.

* Alex's run through of the Jupyter notebook helped me understand what 1D cellular automata is. Additionally, afterwards I asked William about 1D cellular automata since it is a bit confusing for me and I feel I have a better understanding of what it is after both those experiences.

* I also liked how William went through some major theories involved in the history of dynamical systems going into Aristotle, Galileo, and Newton. 
	* Teleology - Aristotle - understanding through logic alone
	* Galileo - Heliocentrism
	* Newton - his laws

How does it connect to what you learned from your own work?

* Alex's Jupyter notebook connected to both the main Langton reading and the cellular automata CORE material
* William's description of chaos tied into the previous descriptions of criticality in the class
	* This also ties into attractor landscapes in the points where the population reaches a new attractor or valley
* It's interesting to think about synchronization in dynamic systems when dynamic systems are defined by the way they are always changing

What would you like to learn more about?

* I want to learn how dynamical systems have been used to understand human behavior and if it is possible to use attractor landscapes to see how people fall into certain political beliefs or systems.
