*Note: This would be in reference the Tuesday of Week 2's class* 
What did you learn from the other student presentations on the Week 1 topic?

* I learned that the 20th century focused mostly on reductionism and breaking things into small components, with a lot of the focus on physics. However, during the latter end, some phenomenon wasn't able to be explained by breaking things down and taking a new angle of studying the emergent behavior in complex systems became a new point to focus on.

* Here is a quote I thought to be helpful from Will's presentation, as it cites a particular way to approach ALife that may be fruitful:
	*“An agenda focused on understanding the constitution, origin, interaction, and transformation of biological individuals in general might provide the missing unifying organization that Artificial Life requires” (Beer, 2024)

* Alex spent a lot of time explaining many of  the proposed factors to go into what would be considered a good behavioral model with the intention of a future application of robots ![[{9A39258B-6F40-4AA9-9E86-E173311E392E} 1.png]]
* He also talked about Self-Organized Criticality using a cylinder as an example -- which I took as the way that as complex systems build up (whether its population or in this case position and angle in the cylinder) there comes a point (a critical point) where even a small change can cause a large outcome (slightly turning the cylinder less than a degree, causing the remote to fall).

* Dominic introduced the concept of "Autonomous evolving artwork" where an
	* Artist works as a gardener, curator, or facilitator rather than a sole creator
* I also liked how he brought up this "Invites audiences to reconsider perceived boundaries between the natural and artificial"
* Neural Zoo
	* I liked how he described this AI generated art of nature as "familiar yet foreign" and that it "speculates on what nature could look like" -- the latter gives me the thought that AI can be used to aid in our creative process rather than simply mimic (and/or steal) as most AI art critics have commented
* I thought the Emotion-Inducing AI Generated Music was far off from its purpose but it is interesting that people are trying to make this
	* Based off of the "How Emotions Are Made" book by Lisa Feldman Barrett I don't think its possible to create a general wide-sweeping emotion-inducing music, as Barrett describes how there isn't one sole point to be pinned down for our emotions and that a lot of it is formed by our interactions with outside information and the reactions between parts of our internal system, rather than a singular part. That is to say that how our emotions are induced are all unique to some capacity between each individual
* Ai-Da
	* It's very interesting to see that there is already a robotic artist that has gotten some notoriety and some of her artwork looks like it could be made by a human artist



How does it connect to what you learned from your own work?

* Will's information around the prospects of ALife connect nicely with Sara Walker's push for a new science. Both point to a unification of science and other disciplines in a way that focuses on emergence rather than reductionism.
* Alex's information brings some ideas of how people have tried to go forth into aspects of ALife with behavioral models, robots, criticality, and artificial chemistry. So this connects with some possible avenues of Sara Walker's new science and I could see be used by Neri Oxman in her fusion of tech and nature.
* Dominic's information about art really delves into expression. This connects well with Oxman's work, as seen most relevantly with Neural Zoo. Additionally, with Ai-Da it makes me wonder if we can get robots to somehow express themselves and come up with their own thoughts, is it possible we can reconcile technology and nature as Oxman is trying to do? 

What would you like to learn more about?

* I want to learn more about how we can apply emergence (and other cool topics we learn about) to understand the world. The avenues that are most fascinating to me are in emotions and how we can represent thoughts and how we ourselves act with one another and how this social interaction differs between offline and online medium. 
	* But it would also be cool to make new discoveries in physical science as well on the side.

## Time Management Plan
How do you plan to manage your time with the expectation of spending  ~3.5 or more hours of time outside of class between Thursday and Tuesday class sessions?

* I plan to start breaking down the material Saturday and hopefully finish Sunday. I will keep track of time and if I get to my book great! But since most of these terms I'm learning about for the first time, there is a probable chance that I will have spent more than 3.5 hours going through the CORE materials and accompanied reading, and won't get to my book in this time.
