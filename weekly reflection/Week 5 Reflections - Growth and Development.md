What did you learn from the other student presentations on this week's topic?
* Will introduced me to several new terms:
	* Artificial Embryogeny - creation of artificial systems that undergo a developmental phase based on a phenotype
	* Grammar Approaches - a broader term that includes L-systems. Also, introduced me to the CS definition of a grammar. 
	* Cell-Chem Approaches - simulating natural cell evolution and chemistry 
* Will also presented his treasure of the Dimensions of AE Systems:
	* Cell Fate
	* Targeting
	* Heterochrony - flexibility across many generations
	* Canalization - mutation tolerance
	* Complexification - new genes added over many generations to increase natural complexity, done organically. I also recall Dr. Yoder making the point that complexification happens in real life, so it's good to hear that the systems we're studying are trying to be as accurate as they can be.
* I particularly liked thinking about how we might parallel the Developmental Hourglass in how we as humans develop.

* From Dominic, I learned about Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN)
	* "Set of DNA segments before or near a gene(s) that describe how it should be expressed" [[Week 5.pdf]]
* And Artificial Gene Regulatory Networks (AGRN)
	* What was surprising to me was the sentiment offered by Dr. Yoder that this implementation is very close to real life and somehow we as humans have created this phenomenon artificially, despite its complexity.
	* Additionally, the sheer difference between being able to model them using a Boolean Network approach where genes are simply on or off to using differential equations was surprising to me. This clues me into that it may be valuable for me to look back on my differential equation notes if I want to make some specific implementations of ALife models.
	* The additional comment on robustness by Dr. Yoder also fascinated me with the conjoined twins example, it's cool that AGRNs are robust enough to handle mutations that still produce a fit offspring just as we see in the physical world. 
	* MapDevo3D is the current best platform for AGRNs

* Alex Brickley continues to amaze me with his ability to create his own simulations. It was great seeing the colorful connections between the particles, which did remind me of the CSSE220 particle simulation assignment. 
	* From the discussion, I also learned more about how similar organisms, including humans, are to one another. Where it has been said that there is a commonality between the building blocks of life like all proteins folding in a certain direction.
	* It was also interesting to think about how one would be able to save a proper state of a connection of particles. I'm excited to hear more about the simulation and how Alex will bring the research from the previous student and incorporated it into his design.


How does it connect to what you learned from your own work?
* Will's Grammar Approaches slide directly mentions L-systems, which was in all three of my readings as well as one of my slides. Will helped give me a broader term to describe developmental systems that are similar to L-systems.
	* [[Wk 5 - Ch. 4 - Organism Growth]]
	* [[Wk 5 - Sections 2.3-2.7]]
	* [[BioAI Developmental Systems Vids]]
	* [[Week 5.pdf]]
* Dominic's mention of using differential equations to model AGRNs reminded me of my *Artificial Life* reading for this week, where activator-inhibitor dynamics, which in the section were used to model the development of seashells, could be described by partial differential equations [[Wk 5 - Sections 2.3-2.7]]

What would you like to learn more about?
* I want to learn how to model voxel automata and neural cellular automata within Minecraft
* I'm also wondering at what point will a product of ALife merge with AI? For physical ALife this would be like me using an LLM. For digital ALife this might mean the ALife intentionally or unintentionally integrating itself with an AI. I would imagine not much would change for the physical ALife, but I wonder if there would be any friction between what rules win out? The digital ALife's original rules or those that the AI is subject to. 
* Additionally, I'm interested in figuring out what was the spark for AI to become so sought after and mainstream and thinking about how that could inform how ALife can be as well-known and sought after, and whether that would be a good thing or not in general.
