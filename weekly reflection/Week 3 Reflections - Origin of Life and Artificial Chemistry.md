*Note: This would be in reference the Tuesday of Week 4's class* 
What did you learn from the other student presentations on the Week 3 topic?

* I learned about the emerging field of hash chemistry from William Greenlee, swarm systems from Dominic, and general artificial chemistry from Alex. 
* From Will, I learned that hash chemistry is very recent! With it originating from 2019, yet already have some great advancements, with Will introducing the paper that goes over Structural Cellular Hash Chemistry that improves on the cons of its hash chemistry predecessors.
* From Dominic, I learned more about swarm systems and chemistry with the term "dynamic re-differentiation" referring to the ability to change type and alter its recipe. I also learned that it has applications to art, which makes me wonder what kind of art swarm dynamics would produce.
* From Alex, I learned that when automatically moving between levels in artificial chemistries, that different issues are caused. I was also exposed to some terms that are used in artificial chemistry like synthesis and catalysis.

How does it connect to what you learned from your own work?

* I learned that artificial chemistry seems to build into it a lot of artificial life due to its ability to take in different dynamics and data and then use it to create a living simulation. Through the presentations, I also got to think more about how Assembly Theory could be used in those fields. 

What would you like to learn more about?

* I want to see how this knowledge has been used to help people.
* I would also like to know about a meta-analysis of all these ALife approaches to help determine which method and description are better at what kinds of data and how formatted it needs to be.
