What did you learn from the other student presentations on this week's topic?
* Dominic talked about self-replication, from him I learned about
	* Langton's Ant
		* 2D Turing Machine / Cellular Automata
		* Can create some really interesting visuals
	* Langton's Loops
		* Expands outward forever
	* von Neumann's Universal Constructor
		* 2D cellular automata with 32 possible states per cell
		* Turing machine
	* PushGP
		* This was particularly interesting as I hadn't thought about a programming system that has a stack for each of its data types before. I wonder what the trade-offs for that kind of implementation are.
	* PyshGP
		* Implementing PushGP in Python
* Alex
	* From Alex, I learned that his continued work on the simulation has reached a stalling point. To get the molecules he wants to make, first he must deal with protons and electrons. Getting the desired interaction has proved to be a big hurdle. Given this, I recommended he talk to Dr. Syed (who teaches Special Relativity and may be able to give good equations for the motion of electrons and electrons) and Dr. Finn (who teaches Tensor Calculus and has taught General Relativity). I have heard that tensors are great for calculating the motion and dynamics of non-linear systems and dealing with various dimensions, so I figured those two would be a good resource.

How does it connect to what you learned from your own work?
* Dominic specifically went over mutation, selection, replication, and evolution, which were all mentioned to some degree in the evolution videos (replication not so much).
* Additionally, self-replication seems to be tangential to evolution in a way that those who get to self-replicate have lived long enough and have met the requirements to self-replicate, which follows along with evolution and survival of the fittest over time.
* Since PushGP and, by extension, PyshGP are tailored for genetic programming, I have the feeling that they would prove beneficial for a variety of evolutionary algorithms.
* Both Dominic and Alex used different simulations with one being in Python using PyshGP and the other using Java. Additionally, the first was used in the context of self-replication and the latter was used for the hopes of AChem. This gives me a wider base of implementations to look into as I consider taking Bio-inspired AI and pursuing further research.

What would you like to learn more about?
* What are the pros and cons of PushGP having type-specific stacks?
* Has PushGP led to any new discoveries?
* How would these evolutionary algorithms be used as species inside of videogames or virtual realities that allow for contact with humans but also other examples of artificial life? Is it possible for us to create an artificial world with artificial beings that we interact with?

## Mid-Term Reflection
How well have you been managing your time?
* I have been managing my time somewhat well. Unfortunately, it seems that I tend to mass up a lot of my work on Sunday and Monday, which coincides with work from other classes. 

How could you (if possible) improve your  time management?
* I could possibly spread my Artificial Life work on more. Ex: spread out readings evenly across across the days between it's assigned and when it's due.
