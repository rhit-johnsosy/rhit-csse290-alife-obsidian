What did you learn from the other student presentations on this week's topic?
* Will G.
	* I learned that "Artificial Life is experimental philosophy"
		* This makes sense as in ALife the scientists go in with a desired output or knowledge and an approach for it accomplishing it and conduct several experiments to prove or disprove this theory rather than simply philosophizing without any simulations.
	* Learned the terms:
		* Cognitive Neuroethology
			* This models neural control in conjunction w/ body-environment interactions
		* Computational Neuroethology
			* Continuous-time recurrent neural networks are used as controllers.
			* The observation that sensor-enabled controllers perform better than the sensorless ones

* Alex:
	* Learned what autopoiesis meant. Definition:
		* "An autopoietic system produces a unity that is topographically and functionally segregated from its background. The operational closure (processes which produce components that are reinserted in the original processes by the means of other processes) of autopoietic systems is a general principle of organisation, which can be applied in many contexts” Olivier David"
	* Also learned some cool human facts:
		* 1% of cells in a human body are human cells, the rest are bacteria
		* Our cells self-organize

* Dominic:
	* Got to see a cool 2D implementation of one of Karl Sims' Evolved Virtual Creatures
		* Learned more about the possibility of unexpected effects of simulated evolution where the creature, in some settings, would hit the edge of the platform just right to go flying.


How does it connect to what you learned from your own work?
* Quote from Will G's Cognitive Neuroethology slide:
	* "The most important evidence suggesting that the nervous system cannot be the exclusive focus for understanding adaptive behavior is that it continuously **receives and responds to feedback** both from the **movements that it induces** in its own **periphery and from the surrounding environment**"
		* Connects with the brain-body-environment system that Izquierdo [[Izquierdo (2016)]] focuses on by having each component work together with the brain receiving and responding to feedback, movement being from the body, and the surrounding environment being the environment.
		* Connects with the idea of sensorimotor contingencies as putting the focus on the result of an interaction rather than trying to isolate a singular thing as being the cause of adaptive behavior [[Kevin O'Regan The sensorimotor approach to understanding feel in humans and robots]] [[Laflaquière et al. (2018)]]
* Will G's Computational Neuroethology seems to be exactly what [[Izquierdo (2016)]] is going for since he's using all the data on the C. elegans to recreate it and understand how it functions through various simulations and experiments. 
* Conway's game of life from Alex's slide seems to be the most re-occurring ALife simulations in my life
	* First introduced to it sophomore year of high school in a C++ class
	* Appeared again when I took CSSE220 as an extra credit problem
	* Has been mentioned multiple times during this class
* Autopoiesis reminds me a lot of when I learned what homeostasis was when I took Biology in high school (which happened to be the best science class I took)
	* Difference is that homeostasis is maintaining internals while externals are changing, where autopoiesis is where life is continuously creating itself. 


What would you like to learn more about?
* Since Artificial Life is an example of experimental philosophy, I wonder what other niche fields fall under experimental philosophy across disciplines, and whether Artificial Life is applicable to them or not.
* How Dominic took Karl Sims 3D models and transferred them to 2D? Did Karl Sims have enough instructions that it was fairly easily to pair down? Did he use any AI to help him code the simulation? How much did taking Bio-AI help him accomplish this feat?
