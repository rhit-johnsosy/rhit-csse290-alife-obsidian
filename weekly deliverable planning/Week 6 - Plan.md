# Plan

* Read into Alexander Mordintsev's work
	* Gather several inspiring pieces of work to present
* Watch Bio-AI Neural System Videos and other CORE resources
* Follow along with at least one (1) code-along  - [Alexander Mordvintsev: neural cellular automata from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7_LGjen7o&ab_channel=ODSAIGlobal)

# Deliverable to Create
* Create 7 minute presentation on Neural Systems (more of a focus on neural cellular automata), including the results of following of the **Code-Along: [Alexander Mordvintsev: neural cellular automata from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA7_LGjen7o&ab_channel=ODSAIGlobal)**, and various other works by Alexander Mordvintsev
