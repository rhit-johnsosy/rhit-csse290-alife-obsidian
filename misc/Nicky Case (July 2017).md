### The Evolution of Trust

* I like the word chillax, adds a nice contrast to the serious topic of trust and international relations

* the cheater got me (I am choosing to cooperate at each turn)

* I'm going to predict detective since I imagine going based off past data is probably best for ensuring optimal performance

* Interesting that they brought the Christmas Truce story back up again

* I imagine the cooperates will get exploited and die by the cheats, but the cheats will starve each other of value, leaving the copycats to live. As such, I'm predicting copycat to come out on top.

* It seems my prediction is enacting itself out before my eyes

* Interesting quote, I wonder what the class thinks about it.

* evolution!!! Is it open-ended?

![[{B5C411B8-FD23-4A5A-8557-ABE0E63E93E9}.png]]
* I've been convinced. Copycat is for sure going to win this.
![[{C8F76D76-698C-44D7-926E-7E630288F1D7}.png]]
* yep
* Copycat probably doesn't win at 1 since there isn't anything to go off and copy but I'd imagine would win in the other scenarios (anything with more than 1 round)

![[{F9631419-B600-444B-A977-F417947024B8}.png]]
* I was wrong. Copycat loses for anything w/ rounds of 5 or less to ALWAYS CHEAT

![[{B2F42098-D469-4C61-ACC2-57EB206F6D14}.png]]
* Ok so now benefit from both cooperating has been reduced by 1, which is half of what it was before. Given that copycat lost in 5 rounds, and now that the benefit for cooperating has dropped by half, I imagine copycat loses in 10 rounds or less. Let's see what happens...

* So interestingly enough the text is saying Always Cheat took over (which is what I thought would happen) but on my screen Copycat won.  But Always Cheat does take the lead for a little bit before being replaced by the Copycats.

* I think this is where the closeness, proximity, and being around the person a lot comes in. Because if they do something out of line and you've known them for a while, you'll probably see that as a fluke and be comfortable confronting about it as a one-time occurrence and get it sorted properly.

* I believe in copykitten as it adjusts for mistakes

* I got it wrong. It is possible that the simpleton language used to describe them initially confused me.


![[{BC122BF2-1445-4658-9D29-8C8741320F75}.png]]
* I still hold out hope for copykitten (maybe I'm too stubborn?)

![[{0BB313F4-CC85-416E-913C-6627BB4BE3FA}.png]]
* Copykitten definitely takes the cake but Copycat still holds on, probably due to them at this point both all agreeing to share
	* Nevermind, tabbed back in and it is all Copykittens, but the Copycats did last for an extended period of time

![[{66382FB4-B9DA-4433-89F7-6E95776A3BF5}.png]]
* 0% I'm gonna guess copycat wins since it picks up what's being put down the first time
* 20% and beyond I'm guessing copykitten takes the cake

![[{D7981510-6ACD-46C8-B609-936970DFD292}.png]]
* was kinda right for 0%, copycat was vast majority for most of the time, but then copycat shrank to 1 but then had a comeback, it seems to have evolved to a stalemate between the two

![[{661C4FCD-397F-4216-9C95-0B877E3FFB97}.png]]
* always cheat won for 20% :(

![[{EA047902-6658-4721-8DDA-6A3D7E8D2B8F}.png]]
* copykitten won for 50%

![[{461C149C-C6C5-40F1-884C-0948AB4FEA81}.png]]
* once again a little bit different from what I got but it is what it is

* **Our problem today isn't just that people are losing trust, it's that our environment acts against the evolution of trust.**
* **we are each others' environment
	* **In the short run, the game defines the players. But in the long run, it's us players who define the game.**
