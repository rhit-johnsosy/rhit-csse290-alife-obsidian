### Parable of the Polygons

""**This is a story of how harmless choices can make a harmful world.**""


* Two different shapes
	* Meh when alone or surrounded by same shape
	* Sad when predominantly surrounded by other shape
	* Happy when around about equal of both
* Segregation of shapes tends to happen with this rule

Several runs of auto-sort on making a random arrangement of shapes have no sad shapes:

* Could have this sandbox as my treasure, it's fun and interactive and insightful. Could also be an activity

* Simulations went from small shapeist tendency still results in segregation -> but adding a tiny demand for diversity results in 0% segregation -> box of friendship: all must work together even through hardship to get to everyone being happy together -> small sandbox for additional insights
