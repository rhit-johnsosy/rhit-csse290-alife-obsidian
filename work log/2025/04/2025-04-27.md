### Log
- Went through the rest of the CORE resources
	- [[Learning]]
		- 15 minutes
	- [[Artificial Neural Networks]]
		- Paper - 10 minutes
		- Code-along - 1 hour
- Neural Cellular Automata Paper Reading/Skimming [[Tavares (2015)]]
	- 30 minutes
- Neural Cellular Automata Code-along
	- 1 hour and 13 minutes
	- Didn't implement very well due to some legacy code but also missing code in the video that I couldn't find after searching for a lengthy period of time
	- Information from beginning of video I grabbed and put in [[Mordvinstev (2020)]]
- Growing Neural Cellular Automata [[Mordvinstev (2020)]]
	- 48 minutes
- Worked on deliverables (slides)
	- 1 hour and 25 minutes
### Next
- Polish off deliverables and possibly find some extra cool stuff to add
