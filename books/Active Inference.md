Refer to Preface for a nice illustration/demo of Active Inference

Pg viii. mentions that Active Inference has accompanied Bayesian mechanics  

Pg. vii "Crucially, it does not aim to replace other frameworks, such as behavioral psychology, decision theory, and reinforcement learning. Rather, it hopes to embrace all those approaches that have proven so successful within a unified framework."

"At the heart of Active Inference lies a generative model--namely, a probabilistic representation of how unobservable causes in the world out there generate the observable consequences--our sensations. Getting the generative model right--as an apt explanation for the sentient behavior of any experimental subject or creature--is the big challenge."

"this book is for people who want to use Active Inference to simulate and model sentient behavior, in the service of either scientific inquiry or, possibly, artificial intelligence." 

A way of understanding the sentient world

**“Active Inference puts the action into perception, whereby perception is treated as perceptual inference or hypothesis testing. Active Inference goes even further and considers planning as inference—that is, inferring what you would do next to resolve uncertainty about your lived world.”**
