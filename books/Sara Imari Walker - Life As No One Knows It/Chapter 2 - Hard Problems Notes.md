Chapter 2 - Hard Problems

“Three great problems that plague scientists and philosophers alike are the origins of matter, the origins of life, and the origins of mind.” pg. 35

  

“While I enjoy the technically hard, I went to graduate school because I love and intellectually thrive in the conceptually hard.” pg. 37

  

“It [the origin of life] is the easiest of the hard problems because it is the one that we can solve in this generation.” pg. 37-38. Further elaborates that understanding this will help us understand the technological transitions we are currently living through and allow us to tackle the other hard problems.

  

“Qualia is the word we use to label and talk about what we all seem to feel in our mental states rendering something, or nothing, or anything at all: it is the felt quality of being.” pg. 38

  

“We can talk about the nature of intrinsic experience and what it feels like to be one of us. But we do so without ever knowing what it is like to be another experiencer.” pg. 38-39

  

“To understand consciousness, scientists aim to measure the subjective, defined as a physical system’s internal or intrinsic experience of the world.” pg. 40

  

“We will never have complete information about any object that exists in our universe, because we can never know about an object without it interacting with another” pg. 42

  

“It is important to keep in mind as a theory builder that whatever you assume as the axioms in your mathematics, or fundamental in your theories of physics, constrains and in many ways determines your subsequent reasoning and worldview. It defines the boundary of what you can explain.” pg. 43

  

What consciousness is -> what consciousness does pg. 45

  

“Rockets are physical evidence of imagination.” pg. 46

  

“His [Takashi - an ALifer in Japan] conjecture is that babies first learn to be conscious from their parents, and therefore the way to build conscious machines would be to teach consciousness to them, like a parent teaches it to a child.” pg. 47

  

“It is not that all matter is conscious, but that consciousness is potentially a window into the mechanism for bringing specific configurations of matter into existence across time.” pg. 48

  

“It is not just that we need new principles, but we also need to rethink how we write down laws of physics in the first place. We need new physics.” pg. 50

  

“Anti-accretion [sending material out into space from a planet] is consistent with the laws of physics because it is not forbidden by them, but it is not explained by them either. It does not happen due to random chance.” pg. 54

  

“The Anthropocene is what scientists have named the modern geological epoch, where it is now abundantly clear humankind has made an indelible impact on the Earth system.” pg. 55

  

“The geological record suggests life first emerged on this planet more than 3.7 billion years ago.” pg 56

  

Key features of information:

1. “it can be copied between very different things.” pg. 57
    
2. “It causes things to happen.” pg. 60
    

  

“In constructor theory, the only transformations that can be caused to occur are those for which there exists a constructor.” pg. 62. Chiara, David, and their colleagues have contributed greatly to constructor theory, which serves as a new theory about physics.

“it implies the existence of certain regularities in our universe.” pg. 62

  

“It is perhaps the most perplexing question of our existence that anything should exist at all. And if something exists, then why not everything?” pg. 63

  

“Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?” A Brief History in Time, Stephen Hawking pg. 65

  

“I greatly admire Stu and his insights, but on this point I disagree. We do not need to iterate over all the functions a screwdriver or any other object might have, because the vast majority of those are irrelevant to the future of our biosphere.” pg. 69

  

“Resolving the dichotomy between the Newtonian and Darwinian descriptions of the world is key to understanding the deeper physics governing the origin of life. This is because the origin of life is the unification point between biology and physics. It is where the universe described by the fixed laws of known physics–a universe without us–must yield to the seemingly endless forms of complexity generated in the evolution of our biosphere or any other. This unification must happen in what we call chemistry, because chemistry is the first thing the universe builds where not every object can exist (recall how large even small molecule space is).” pg. 72

  

Makes the argument on page 73 that the future isn’t the posing of yes/no questions and the registration of measurement-evoked information theoretic responses to them, but what is “constructed by those responses.”
