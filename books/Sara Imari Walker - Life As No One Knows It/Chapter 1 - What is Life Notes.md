Chapter 1 - What is Life?

"At the 2012 meeting of the American Chemical Society, in a session on the origin of life, Andrew Ellington proposed a radical theory: "Life does not exist."" Pg. 1

  

"Physics, as we collectively understand it at this moment in history, provides a fundamental description of a universe devoid of life. It's not the universe I live in, and I bet you don't live there either." Pg. 3

Scientists used to believe life exists as a separate category from matter. Pg. 3

* "Animated matter was believed to be imbued with a "vital" force, sometimes referred to as the Ã©lan vital. Aristotle called it entelechy; Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnix called it monads." Pg 3

  

"There is no life conservation law that says life cannot be created or destroyed. Of course, this is obvious, because we know organisms are born and due--but sometimes it is the most obvious observations that are the hardest to explain scientifically, and harder still to turn into mathematical law." Pg 6

  

"What modern science has taught us is that life is not a property of matter." Pg 6

  

"Kids can also misclassify life by assuming inanimate objects, like a favorite stuffed animal, are life. Are they wrong in doing this, or are we wrong in correcting them?" Pg 7

  

"We don't yet have a general understanding of the category of things that we should group together and call "life." Therefore either our categorization is wrong or life is not something to be categorized." Pg 13

  

"Incidentally, the fact that explanatory theories work in physics, and science more broadly, is itself an important clue into the nature of life. Life is, after all, the only kind of physical system we know of that can write down explanations like the laws of physics." Pg 16

  

"If there is a fundamental unit of life, it is not an individual organism, because no individual is isolated from the evolutionary chain of events that produced it." Pg 17

  

Need a new physics that derives the properties of life. Pg 27

  

"Science is first and foremost a social endeavor." Pg 29

  

Talking to Nobel Prize winning physicist Frank Wilczek about what life is. He disagreed with her ideas saying they were "not intuitive" but went further on to say "Maybe the problem of life is not a natural kind." Pg 32

Philosophers refer to categories as kinds. A kind is natural when it reflects the structure of the natural world and not our own subjective views as humans.

"I'm pretty sure Frank was implying that the way we talk about life is not a category the universe recognizes but is rather a human-derived construct. I could not agree with this point then. But I have conduct to think that this is probably right. As is the fact that life does not exist, at least not in the way we currently think it does. That something is missing from the modern foundations of physics which we might explain, and in turn derive, life's key features is, however, a very real possibility." Pg. 32-33
