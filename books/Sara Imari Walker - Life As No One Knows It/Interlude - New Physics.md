"On September 14, 2015, we made first contact with the phenomenon your intuition told us existed. We do not have to tell you this is one hundred years after you formalized your ideas! Did you and Marcel think it would take so long? Perhaps you would think this was quick." pg. 76

"To get to a universal understanding of what life is, we must do what theoretical physics does best--abstract the nature of reality to its most fundamental and powerful explanations. Universal includes us humans, our ancestors--from microbes to multicellular life--artificial life, artificial intelligence, what comes after those, and even aliens." pg. 78

"What we are about to embark on next is a vision of a future where we understand what we are, not based on theoretical physics as it was--the kind of physics Albert Einstein devised, with his predecessors Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell, his contemporaries Marie Curie and Emmy Noether, and his successors Richard Feynman, Steven Weinberg, and Frank Wilczek, among many others. They all studied the nonliving universe: the universe without us." pg. 78-79

"Instead, we are now stepping into a possible history of what physics will be if we are to explain the most intimate of physical phenomena--the nature of ourselves. You are a part of that lineage, too, and it is only by accruing knowledge over our lineages that we can understand how it is that we came to be." pg. 79
