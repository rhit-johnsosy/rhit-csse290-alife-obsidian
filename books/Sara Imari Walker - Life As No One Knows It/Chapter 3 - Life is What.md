"Without knowing about gravity, it would seem truly fanciful to imagine the reason I stay in my chair is the same reason the Moon stays in orbit around the Earth." pg. 82

"It [universal law of gravitation] played a central role in the unification of motion in the heavens and on Earth; it's all governed by the same rules." pg. 82

"It's not that the idiosyncratic details of biology as it evolved on Earth don't matter. They just do not matter if you want to understand life as a universal phenomenon." pg. 83

"Modern theoretical physics has three primary pillars--quantum mechanics, general relativity, and statistical physics." pg. 84

"Most of the things that could be made will never be made." pg. 85

"While most of us build theories by manipulating abstractions in our minds, Lee builds theories by manipulating physical objects in the real world." pg. 87

"Life is the only thing in the universe that can make objects that are composed of many unique, recursively constructed parts." pg. 88-89

**"But as a classically trained theoretical physicist I did not htink the ideas would be testable in my lifetime. Lee aimed to prove me wrong. Early in our collaboration he pushed me to ground my thinking in what we can measure, and this exercise has made all the difference in the reality I now see written in the story of life."** pg. 89-90

Objects are finite and distinguishable.
Objects are breakable. pg. 91

"What is considered fundamental in modern physics merely defines the boundary of what we can observe." pg. 92

"In assembly theory, we do not define objects this way (as what we cannot break down further). Instead we define objects as all things that can be built from elementary building blocks using operations that are consistent with the physics of our universe. Objects are therefore the opposite of what they are in physics: they are the things you can build and break apart." pg. 92

"In fact, in assembly theory we regard almost no causation to exist in elementary objects, because causation is built up over time along lineages." pg. 92

Objects exist more than once. pg. 92

Objects are lineages.
Objects form via selection. pg. 94

# Assembly Theory pg. 95

"The *assembly index* is how we formalize how hard it is for the universe to build something." pg. 95
"For a given object, the *assembly space* is defined as the pathway by which that object can be built from elementary building blocks, using only recursive operations combining what has already been built in the past." pg. 95

"The assembly index is the length of the shortest assembly pathway within the molecule's assembly space." pg. 97

pg. 97 LEGO activity - would be a cool thing to do if I had more time

"the nondivisible LEGO bricks are your "atoms" and they come preconfigured with "bonds" because of the structure of how they can attach to one another." pg. 97

"assembly spaces carry with them implicitly a notion of memory of the past." pg. 98

"You cannot use an object to make something new until that object itself exists." pg. 98

"assembly theory escribes every object you interact with as a recursive stack of its history. You might think of assembly theory as a theory of physics where history is a physical attribute." pg. 98

"The set of steps you would have taken (or maybe did take, if you made your own LEGO version) is what we call an assembly pathway." pg. 98

"The assembly space we care about in assembly theory is the one with the shortest number of steps: this assembly space minimally captures the amount of causation necessary to make the object." pg. 98

Minecraft mention pg. 99

"There are two constraints we recognize in the physics of assembly theory: (1) the laws of physics that govern the assembly process (e.g., the laws that determine what can happen in our universe), and (2) the information that is the constructor of the object (e.g., you in the LEGO example), which must be remembered for the object to be generated. The LEGO object cannot exist without something like you to build it." pg. 99

"The constraints on how LEGO blocks can stick together are a bit like the bonding rules of chemistry, which apply as universal rules in our real universe." pg. 99

"The object you constructed was already a member of a restricted set, with constraints imposed by your memories (which bound the space of your imagination), as well as what you have time and resources to build." pg. 100

"Objects with a larger assembly index take more minimal steps to build, and there are also exponentially more of them. We are playing with just a few blocks but imagine if I had asked you to build a LEGO Hogwarts as your target object, by following every possible path to construct it. There would be a lot of paths indeed! You would still be going. The shortest path would be quite long (I have not personally calculated the assembly index of LEGO Hogwarts), and whether you got there at all would depend on how much of a shared history you and I have, reflected by whether you even know what I mean when I say "LEGO Hogwarts."" pg. 100

"We remove the context dependence by focusing on the features of the object that will be the same no matter where we observe it. In this sense we do not care what function or meaning the DNA has, only that DNA requires something to already exist that can build it (e.g., a cell, or a laboratory)--that is, we care that DNA is itself a product of evolution." pg. 103

**"We cannot look at DNA on its own as an object and say what its meaning is. But we can measure the minimal path to make DNA, independent of what built it or were we find it."** pg. 103

"This brings us to one of the most important reasons we use the minimal path in assembly theory: it is agnostic and does not depend on the chemistry of life as we know it. We can go in the lab and measure it using several different instruments, and we can measure it for *any molecule*." pg. 103

# Assembled, Not Random: Why Evolution Is Necessary to Build Complexity in the Universe
"in assembly theory nearly all the information about what objects are built over time emerges in the trajectories of lineages." pg. 107

"A consequence of assembly theory is that we should not expect objects with a high assembly number to ever form spontaneously." pg. 113

"You are never alone in the assembled universe--every evolved object must come with many others related to it." pg. 115

# Building a Life Meter
"A good life meter should be capable of identifying things that cannot be produced in the absence of life, ever." pg. 119

Orbitrap
"By breaking the molecule apart into fragments we can look at the number of unique parts, and this is how we determine the assembly index as the minimal number of parts needed to build the molecule." pg. 122

"Using the same logic as our random structure exploration, Cole Mathis, then a postdoc working with Lee, now starting up his own lab at Arizona State University, was able to calculate that at approximately fifteen steps in to the assembly space of molecules, we should not expect to see more than one copy of a given molecular structure in a 10^23 molecular sample. In other words, fifteen is about where we hit the threshold of one copy per mole without selection." pg. 124

# Time as Material
**"Assembly theory represents a new possible kind of unification: that of matter and computation"** pg. 130

"In molecular assembly theory, we interpret the assembly space as the physical molecule, meaning that the material description of a molecule is composed of the physical rules--or algorithms--for its construction." pg. 133

"Consider this for your LEGO object--each time you deconstruct and reconstruct it, you are unfolding the object across time, resolving features of its assembly space." pg. 134

"what assembly is telling us is that *complex matter is complex because it has a physical extent not just in space, but in time too.*" pg. 134

"In assembly theory, what we call life and concepts of computation, matter, and time are all the same thing; the physical structure underlying them is the assembly space. We can now unify the concepts of computation and matter, but we will need to redefine what we consider material. In assembly theory, the material property is the assembly space, which has a size or depth in time. The size of an object in time, in terms of how much "information" or "causation" is necessary to build an object, is a material property." pg. 136

**"In order for life to exist as a natural kind, we need a new concept of time as material."** pg. 136

# Life but Not Alive
"*everything* in the biosphere and technosphere must be constructed over time, and therefore all biological and technological objects must be continually reconstructed if they are to persist in time" pg. 138

"You are rebuilding yourself across time--this is why you must continually eat to keep yourself alive." pg. 138

"In developing a theory for life, we're aiming to move past the cursory descriptors to identify the deepest structure that can explain life." pg. 139

"Complex objects, such as molecules, can come into existence only if there is something that can build them reliably, whether it is a cell, an environment, or an intelligent agent. These objects require an algorithmic process to assemble them." pg. 140

"All objects that require information to specify their existence constitute "life." Life is the high-dimensional combinatorial space of what is possible for our universe to build that can be selected to exist as finite, distinguishable physical objects."
"Being "alive," by contrast, is the trajectories traced through that possibility space. The objects that life is made of and that it constructs exist along causal chains extended in time; these lineages of information propagating through matter are what it is to be "alive."" pg. 141

"Being alive is not binary, it is a spectrum. The more things that can be constructed by a given object, the more alive it is." pg. 142

"Things that require a lot of steps become increasingly improbable to observe if there is no process that has selected for the specific causal chain leading to that object. This is the insight we need to recognize alien life on other worlds, and to evolve *de novo* life from scratch in the lab." pg. 142

"If we focus on how objects are made, we can unify the description of individuals, lineages, or even the collection of all lineages from an origin-of-life event: these are all examples of assembling objects contingent on using parts that were assembled in the past." pg. 143

"The fundamental unit of life is not the cell, nor the individual, but the lineage of information propagating across space and time. The branching pattern at the tips of this structure is what is alive now, and it is what is constructing the future on this planet." pg. 143
