"evolution of learning and the evolution of consciousness are intimately linked" pg 34

"The belief that life entails sentience is inspired by the incredible complexity and adaptability of cells." Pg 36

"What is meant by intelligence is not always clear, but usually the ability to learn and make complex decisions are considered reliable markers of intelligence. Slime molds can do both." Pg 38
Interesting example: **“When oat-flakes were arranged to represent Tokyo and thirty-six surrounding towns, the creature created a network similar to the existing train system in Japan “with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost.””** pg. 38

Nervous system has 5 special properties: connectivity, a common language, contact specificity, high speed, and a new type of memory (synapses)

"The simplest animals with a brain are the creepy-crawly worms, an ill-defined assembly of limbless, elongated animals with bilateral symmetry" pg 50

"Worms illustrate the marvels of behavioral adaptation, memory, and the many feats of learning that a simple brain can support."

Human consciousness used as the default benchmark. Pg 54

"Giant manta rays check out their reflections in a mirror in a way that suggests that they may be self-aware: they do not try to socially interact with the mirror, but move their fins, blow bubbles, and circle in front of the mirror."

"Common sense is a good starting point, but it is not sufficient. A theory of consciousness is needed if we are to recognize which animals are conscious." Pg 82  

"Evolutionary theory is the most powerful theory in biology, a conceptual bottleneck through which every theory of life and mind must pass. If a biological (or psychological, or sociological) theory is incompatible with evolutionary theory, it is likely that something is seriously wrong with it." Pg 82

"Recognizing the earliest forms of consciousness enables us to identify basic processes and principles that can br applications to all consciousness organisms and offers a tentative answer to the "Who is conscious" question." Pg 82

"Evolutionary theory is a deceptively simple theory" pg. 84

First assumption: a single ancestors, or very few ancestors, of all organisms. Principle of Descent with modification

2nd principle: natural selection
  
Gianti - created a list of what qualifies as life and then built a theoretical minimum viable lifeform. They take a similar approach to evolution and consciousness. Pg 92

Finding out a transition marker for when a lifeform goes from being unconscious to meeting all the requirements for consciousness is vital

"To borrow a phrase attributed to Einstein, we want a list of capacities that is "as simple as possible, but not simpler."" Pg 96  

Simplest form of consciousness characteristics:
* Unity and multiplicity: A conscious being has the capacity to form unified images of the world and the body. These images change incessantly as they are updated, yet each is a unified whole.
* Global accessibility and broadcast: For a conscious state to be constructed, information from different cognitive systems-sensory, motor, memory, evaluation, and attentional systems-must become integrated, enabling comparison, discrimination, generalization, prediction, and evaluation that inform decision-making.
* Selective exclusion and attention: Each conscious state excludes other states. For example, if each eye is presented with a different picture, one does not see a mixture of the two pictures, but alternates between seeing one or the other picture.
* Intentionality ("aboutness") representation: Conscious states are about the body and the world. The incoming stimuli from the world and the body are matched against the rough expectation you have.
* Integration over time: Subjective experiences have duration-they are not instantaneous.
* Affective value systems and goals: Perceptions and actions are evaluated as rewarding or punishing within a space of feelings that includes drives such as thirst and hunger, and emotions such as fear and joy.
* Embodiment and agency: Consciousness is a dynamic mode of being instantiated in a material body.
* A sense of self: A conscious organism has a stable perspective from which it experiences the world and identifies things and events.

Marker of consciousness: unlimited associative learning (UAL)
  
"it was discovered that learning depends on how surprising, how unexpected, the predictive neutral stimulus or action is of the reinforcement" pg 102

"Unlimited associative learning (UAL) is the within-lifetime analogies of unlimited heredity in evolutionary time. An organism with a capacity for UAL can, during its own lifetime, go on learning from experience about the world and about itself in a practically unrestricted way." Pg. 107
- distinguish between novel complex patterns of stimuli and actions
- manifests second-order learning
- can learn even if there is a time gap between the "neutral" complex stimulus and the reinforcement
- the value of a learned pattern can be readily changed

UAL is a testable capacity. Pg 114
