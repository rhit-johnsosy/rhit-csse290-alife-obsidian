Alchemy and chemistry both are useful in studying Artificial Life and Artificial Chemistry as seen in the Miller-Urey experiment.

Miller-Urey
* Consisted of two chambers one with water, one with various gases to model Earth's early atmosphere, water chamber was heated and amino acids were created.

"Together, a researcher’s specification of these three aspects of a  
simulation: atomic or molecular ingredients, reaction rules,  
and the dynamic process by which they interact in a particular  
virtual environment, define an artificial chemistry" pg. 43


"New, artificial systems can be  
worthy of study in their own right. They make their own facts." pg. 44

"To support the existence of the virtual organisms that are intended to appear, four types of catalyst are  
required. A chlorophyll-like catalyst is needed that, in the presence of “sunlight” (described shortly), manufactures a complex molecule equivalent to sugar. An enzyme that breaks  
down this sugar, releasing the chemical energy stored in its  
bond is also needed." pg. 47

"The only  
way energy can be stored is in complex molecules" pg. 47

Good example of several biology vocab terms: "Photosynthesis constructs sugar molecules from water and  
carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen and water. It requires the  
presence of the catalyst chlorophyll and incident sunlight" pg. 48

"Seemingly any system of interacting dynamic components might be classified under the banner of Artificial Chemistry! Since even completely imaginary  
chemistries can be informative, as long as the metaphors used  
are helpful to describe or explain observations of these dynamical systems, and their authors are clear that these are  
metaphors only, there is, in this author’s opinion, no harm in  
using them." pg. 54
