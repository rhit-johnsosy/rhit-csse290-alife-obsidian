Simulation Models as Opaque Thought Experiments

### Notes (use any/all to guide you):

Two opposed perspectives, simulation models as "emergent computational thought experiments" and simulation models as realistic simulacra.

"In summary, by claiming that evolutionary simulation modelling is a new technique which should properly be applied exclusively to a new class of problems, modellers incur a risk of scientific isolation and an attendant lack of rigour." pg. 2

"the difficulties faced by equational models in capturing non-linearities, or increasingly complex inter-dependencies between the action of agents, are largely absent from simulation-based models" pg. 3

Evolutionary simulation models offer advantages over traditional methods, but this must be tested on a case-by-case basis. pg. 3

"Scientists decide to pay attention to "problems defined by the conceptual and instrumental techniques already at hand" (ibid., p. 262). Therefore, some facts, although known, are pushed to the periphery of scientific investigation, either because they are thought not to be relevant, or because their study would demand unavailable techniques." pg. 5

Difference between thought experiments and abstract simulation models:
* thought experiments: has a conclusion that follows logically and clearly, so that the experiment is an explanation of its own conclusion and implications. Otherwise, it's fruitless.
* simulation: can be much more powerful and versatile, but at a price (explanatory opacity - behavior is not understandable by simple inspection). pg. 6

genetic drift - random fluctuations in finite populations - pg. 7

Three different phases for using simulations (pg 9):
1. Exploratory phase
2. Experimental phase
3. Explanatory phase
