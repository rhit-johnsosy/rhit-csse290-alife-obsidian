# Self-Organization and Artificial Life

"Self-organization can be broadly defined as the ability of a system to display ordered spatiotemporal patterns solely as the result of the interactions among the system components." abstract

Examples of self-organization:
"Natural examples are found in areas such as collective motion [198], as when birds or fish move in flocks or schools exhibiting complex group behavior; morphogenesis [120], in which cells in a living body divide and specialize to develop into a complex body plan; and pattern formation [36] in a variety of physical, chemical, and biological systems [29, 49], such as convection and crystal growth as well as the formation of patterns like stripes and spots on animal coats." Section 1

There is no single agreed upon definition of self-organization.

"One way to classify ALife research is to divide it into _soft_, _hard_, and _wet_ domains, roughly referring to computer simulations, physical robots, and chemical/biological research (including living technology as the application of ALife [21]), respectively. Self-organization has played a central role in work in all three domains." Section 3

"Soft ALife, or mathematical and computational modeling and simulation of lifelike behaviors, has been linked to self-organization in many subdomains." Section 3.1

"Similarly, partial differential equations (PDEs), a continuous counterpart of CAs, have an even longer history of demonstrating self-organizing dynamics [52, 76, 142, 190] (Figure 1(b))." Section 3.1

"Since a large part of soft and hard ALife research deals with agents, animats, or robots (virtual or physical) being controlled by artificial neural networks, it can be said that self-organization is present not only at the behavioral level, but also at the controller level in many cases." Section 3.1

"Hardware has the strong advantage that the physical characteristics of the system (dynamics, sensor performance, actuator noise profiles, etc.) are by definition realistic, whereas simulations are necessarily simplified and typically fail to capture phenomena that only become evident through material experimentation [27, 97, 162]." Section 3.2

"Wet ALife, or physico-chemical synthesis of lifelike behaviors, extensively utilizes self-organization as its core principle. A classic example is spatial pattern formation in experimentally realized reaction-diffusion systems, such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction [3, 192] and Gray-Scott-like self-replicating spots [55, 122], where dynamic patterns self-organize entirely from spatially localized chemical reactions." Section 3.3

"In research on the origins of life, molecular self-assembly plays the essential role in producing protocell structures and their metabolic dynamics [84, 155, 156, 157]." Section 3.3

"Internal self-organization would occur within an individual or agent, and could be functional for the production of lifelike properties (e.g., morphogenesis) as well as useful for determining physical characteristics or behavioral responses that determine the way in which the individual agent interacts with its environment (e.g., pattern formation, neural plasticity)." Section 4

"External self-organization is that occurring among individuals or agents. Such forms of self-organization pertain to the social aspects of life like processes, which are often fundamental to support reproduction and survival." Section 4

"An orthogonal direction that characterizes a self-organizing system concerns the nature of the interactions among the system components that bring about the lifelike spatiotemporal patterns. In this respect, it is customary to distinguish between _direct_ and _indirect_ (e.g., stigmergic) forms of interaction." Section 4

"the concept of indirect interactions has been expanded to include any external medium that can store information and thus allow for coordination without the need of synchronous, direct communication." Section 4

Section 4

"The ALife community can progress owing to shared concepts and definitions, and despite the mentioned difficulties, self-organization stands as a common ground on which to build consensus. Most importantly, we believe that the identification and classifications of the _mechanisms_ that underpin self-organization can be extremely useful to synthesize novel forms of ALife and gain a better understanding of life itself." Section 5

"The possibility of exploiting self-organization for design purposes is especially relevant to the development of _living technologies_, that is, technologies presenting features of living systems [21], such as robustness, adaptability, and self-organization, which can include self-reconfiguration, self-healing, self-management, self-assembly, and so on, often named together as “self-*” in the context of autonomic computing [149]." Section 5

"_Can the macroscopic outcomes of self-organization be predicted?_ Interactions in complex systems generate novel information that is not present in initial or boundary conditions, limiting predictability. This is referred to as “computational irreducibility” [66, 212]" Section 6

"_How can understanding of self-organization in ALife benefit other disciplines?_ These include biology, medicine, engineering, philosophy, sociology, economics, and more. Independent of whether ALife is credited or not, the question is whether ALife research will be able to contribute to the solution of problems that otherwise would not be solvable. There are promising examples and successful case studies (e.g., [30, 109]), but broader adoption and dissemination are required to make a difference." Section 6
