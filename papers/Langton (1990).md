"Cellular automata are discrete space/time logical universes, obeying their own local physics" pg. 13

"In order to make our studies more tractable, we  
impose two further conditions on the rule space.  
First, a strong quiescence condition: all neighbor-  
hood states uniform in cell state s i will m a p to  
state s i. Second, an isotropy condition: all planar  
rotations of a neighborhood state will map to the  
same cell state" pg. 15

"7` (lambda) discriminates well between dynamical regimes for "large" values of K and N, whereas 7` (lambda) discriminates poorly for small values of K and N" pg. 15

Three fundamental features of dynamics supported by the underlying transition function physics. (pg 16)
1. storage of information
2. transmission of information
3. stored and transmitted information must be able to interact with one another

Wolfram has proposed the following four qualitative classes of CA behavior: (pg. 16)
1. Class I evolves to a homogeneous state
2. Class II evolves to simple separated periodic structures
3. Class III yields chaotic aperiodic patterns
4. Class IV yields complex patterns of localized structures

"Wolfram finds the following analogs for his  
classes of cellular automaton behaviors in the field  
of dynamical systems.  
Class I cellular automata evolve to limit points.  
Class II cellular automata evolve to limit cycles.  
Class III cellular automata evolve to chaotic  
behavior of the kind associated with strange at-  
tractors.  
Class IV cellular automata "effectively have very  
long transients ""

"Therefore, by varying the X parameter through-  
out 0.0 < h < 0.75 over the space of possible K = 4,  
N = 5, 1D cellular automata, we progress from  
CAs exhibiting the maximal possible order to CAs  
exhibiting the maximal possible disorder. At intermediate values of X, we encounter a phase transition between periodic and chaotic dynamics, and  
while the behavior at either end of the X spectrum  
seems "simple" and easily predictable, the behavior in the vicinity of this phase transition seems "complex" and unpredictable." pg. 24

"First, transients grow rapidly in the vicinity of  
the transition between ordered and disordered dy-  
namics, a phenomenon known in the study of  
phase transitions as critical slowing down. The  
relationship between transient length and 2~ is  
plotted in fig. 3" pg. 25

"Von Neumann observed that:  
" There is thus this completely decisive property  
of complexity, that there exists a critical size be-  
low which the process of synthesis is degenerative,  
but above which the phenomenon of synthesis, if properly arranged, can become explosive, in other words, where syntheses of automata can proceed  
in such a manner that each automaton will pro-  
duce other automata which are more complex and  
of higher potentialities than itself."" pg. 35-36
