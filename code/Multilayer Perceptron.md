* What the coding project was about
	* Coding up a basic neural network as specified by https://dev.to/liashchynskyi/creating-of-neural-network-using-javascript-in-7minutes-o21
	* A part of the CORE resources for Week 6 [[Artificial Neural Networks]]
* Created From Code Along
* Code: (Link to Code (can be embedded in this repo or an external GitHub code repo) )
	* https://github.com/rhit-johnsosy/basic-neural-network
* Demo: (Link/Embed Demo Video OR Image OR  Insert Animated Image (example [[circuit_output.gif]] ))

* Time Spent: (Approximately how much time spent in hours )
	* 1 hour
* Description: (Describe work/experiment/results)
	* Helped visualize and figure out how neural networks work.

## Reflection on Learning
* (What did you learn from doing this?
	* I learned the barebones of what goes into making a neural network
	* I also now have a piece of code that I can reference if I went to make my own neural networks or build off of this existing one


## Future Ideas
* (What else could you do with this with more time?)
	* Add modifications to see how that changes the error.
