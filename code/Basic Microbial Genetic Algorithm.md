* What the coding project was about
	* Implementing Harvey's Microbial Genetic Algorithm in Python to show to the class.
* Created From Scratch / Use Existing Codebase/Framework
	* Created using the pseudocode on the eighth page of Harvey (2009). User interface created by William Greenlee. Differentiations from pseudocode from Dr. Yoder's thought experiments during class.
* Code: (Link to Code (can be embedded in this repo or an external GitHub code repo) )

* Demo: (Link/Embed Demo Video OR Image OR  Insert Animated Image (example [[circuit_output.gif]] ))

* Time Spent: (Approximately how much time spent in hours )
	* 2.5 hours
* Description: (Describe work/experiment/results)
	* I read through and took notes of Harvey's Microbial Genetic Algorithm paper and then used that background information as well as his pseudocode from the paper to create the base implementation of it in Python. Then, I brought the code to William and we discussed what the code does while William added a nice user text interface to run through generations. In class, Dr. Jason Yoder, had us modify the Deme size and our eval() function to experiment and test our understanding of the algorithm. 
	* Through this, we were able to get almost all 1s, almost all 0s, and almost all 1s or 0s in different sections of the population.

## Reflection on Learning
* I learned that genetic algorithms can be fairly simple in implementation, while also being able to give a glimpse of complex topics like evolution. 
* I also learned that deme refers to a specific section of a population, a good analogy would be a neighborhood given that the cluster is based off of proximity.
* Additionally, I found out that **^=** is the XOR operator that flips bit values. As I haven't taken any computer engineering or low-level programming classes I was unfamiliar with this but was happily introduced to it in the pseudocode. This revelation makes me wonder how worthwhile it would be for me to learn more about computer hardware and/or low-level programming. 
* This example will serve as something I look back to when I program future genetic algorithms or have the need to implement a tournament-based decision.

## Future Ideas
* Since there are higher levels of the microbial genetic algorithm and many variations (as seen by Dr. Yoder's prodding in-class), I could build off this one and see how complex I can get it while still giving useful and understandable results.
* I am interested in seeing how more developed and applied versions of genetic algorithms will affect the way people use products or how it affects the media we ingest. It is possible that I could develop my own, apply it, and come up with some hypothesis on how it will make people react, possibly through implementation or direct user testing.
