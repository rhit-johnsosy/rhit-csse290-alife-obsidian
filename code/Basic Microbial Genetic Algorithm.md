* What the coding project was about
	* Implementing Harvey's Microbial Genetic Algorithm in Python to show to the class.
* Created From Scratch / Use Existing Codebase/Framework
	* Created using the pseudocode on the eighth page of Harvey (2009). User interface created by William Greenlee. Differentiations from pseudocode from Dr. Yoder's thought experiments during class.
* Code: (Link to Code (can be embedded in this repo or an external GitHub code repo) )
	* 
* Demo: (Link/Embed Demo Video OR Image OR  Insert Animated Image (example [[circuit_output.gif]] ))
* Time Spent: (Approximately how much time spent in hours )
* Description: (Describe work/experiment/results)

## Reflection on Learning
