The Week 1 Slides is the full presentation in a PDF of all the deliverables presented for the first week of CSSE290 - Artificial Life during the 2024-2025 academic year Spring quarter.

The only work in there that is my own are the slides with "Steven Johnson" in the title. Quotes and testimonials used in my slides are subject to Sara Imari Walker, Neri Oxman, and Lex Fridman, and their correspondents. 

The rest of the slides are by Dr. Jason Yoder and the fellow students William Greenlee, Alex Brickley, and Dominic Reilly.
