	* Is consciousness just brain activity or something more?
* Functionalism
	* Focus on function rather than what it's made out of

	* Provide both ancient wisdom and modern research insights into the depths and heights of human awareness
Persistent Questions
* highlight the enduring mysteries and philosophical dilemmas that continue to intrigue those studying consciousness 
* The Hard Problem
	* How do physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experience?
* The Binding Problem
	* Our senses provide disparate info yet we experience a unified reality, how does our brain combine these into a single conscious experience?
