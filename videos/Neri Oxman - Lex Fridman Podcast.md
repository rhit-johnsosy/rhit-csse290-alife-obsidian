Notes I took while listening to the podcast:
- “Whenever we start a new project, it has to have these ingredients of simultaneous complexity. It has to be novel in the synthetic biology, material science, robotics, engineering. All of these elements that are discipline-based or rooted must be novel. If you can combine novelty in synthetic biology with a novelty in robotics, with a novelty in material science, with a novelty in computational design, you are bound to create something novel.” Neri Oxman
    
- Defines nature as everything that isn’t made by humans
    
- Seeks to close the growing gap between nature and humans
    
- Finding new truths in nature
    
- Nature has “wisdom beyond intelligence”
    
- In 2020, Anthropomass (human-made material) outweighed biomass for the first time
    
- Is there a world where we can synergize human-made objects with nature in a way that amplifies it?
    
- Can we interface with and program nature?
    
- Bio renewable products
    
- Hero organism–silkworms, mycelium, or some other organism that are building organic products
    
- More than 17,000 silkworms used to make a pavilion
    
- “How can technology augment or enable a swarm-like behavior in species that have not been designed to work as swarms?”
    
- Synthetic apiary made first for bees to survive in Winter, made again for space, with the goal of keeping them alive and reproductive
    
- Vespers - Death Mask - organic looking masks using computational programs
    
- Agential material
    
- “We use language models, they use molecular models.” referring to plants, more specifically how grass gives off a smell to communicate that they are being cut/destroyed to other grass
    
- Interactable fragrance. Engineering fragrances to communicate with other organisms (focusing on plants)
    
- “I believe in love”
    
- “Empowerment is a force with a direction.”
    
- “Emergence is multi-directional.”
    
- “Empowerment can happen without emergence.”
    
- “Emergence relies on empowerment.”
    
- “Creativity is all about letting go.”
    
- “Fate is the ratio of who you are and who you want to be.”
    
- “That suspension of disbelief is absolutely a part of the creative act.”
    
- “It is necessary for something beautiful to be imperfect.”
    
- “The vulnerability is what is the glue. Connection is the glue.”
    
- “Cherishing is a very meaningful part of everyday life,”
    
- Glass blowing 3D printing
    
- “You can learn a lot about a person’s future by spending time hearing them talk about their past.”
