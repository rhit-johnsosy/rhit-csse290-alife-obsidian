* Was the director of the laboratory of perception of the Paris Descartes University
* specialty: consciousness
* sensory motor theory
* the slides he is using are from 2013
* video posted on YouTube Jun 17, 2014
* Article
	* Nao - 2010 Daily Mail Reporter - claims Nao is the first robot to feel emotions and form bonds w/ humans that look after it
		* laughter from crowd after Kevin asks "Do you really believe this?"
		* Kevin claims the laughter is evidence of the crowd's doubt
		* "probably very few people believe that a robot will ever be able to have the emotions of a human -- most people are wrong"
			* Why does it matter that robots have the emotions of a human? Wouldn't it be more interesting if they had different emotions? What would those reveal about us?
* "There is nothing to stop robots from having real feels!"
	* quote from his slideshow
* How would we go about this?
	* First example: pain. Let's look at how human experience it.

* How do we create the hurt of pain?
* "Let's leave pain aside and focus on a more basic question: color"
* What makes us feel the colors the way they are?
* What makes red feel red rather than green?
	* In the retina there are 3 types of photoreceptors called cones:
		* l
		* m
		* s.
		* sensitive to long, medium, and short wavelength bands of light
		* packed density on the retina

* higher up in the visual system
	* 3 signals are recombined in different ways
		* give two color channels and one luminance channel
			* color signal gives a signal that's proportional to the equilibrium between red and green and a signal that's proportional to the equilibrium between blue and yellow
* If you wanted to get a red, what would you do?
	* maximize the red green channel in the red direction and the blue yellow channel should be activated in the neutral position
		* unfortunately, this does not happen
		* instead must add excitation in the blue yellow channel
		* to see true blue you must have some green activation

* visual cortex
	* V4 is the area people think is mostly concerned with color perception
		* but what exactly is it? (moves on to another problem)

* problem of sensory presence
![[{F0929D36-EF7C-4CE6-A6D4-058D851CE0AD}.png]]
* consider the feeling of redness
	* if you think about redness
		* then there's no feel
		* no sensory presence
* What is it about the brain areas concerned with thinking that doesn't give you that sensory presence that you have when you have sensory feel?
* What is it about the sensory areas that give you that sensory presence that you don't have with thinking?
* Consider the nervous system and regulation of glucose in our blood
	* complex sensory systems and yet you don't feel them, no sensory presence like the redness of red
		* Why? could try to answer
			* neurotransmitters
			* connectivity
			* quantum gravity effects in the microtubules
			* but then question becomes what is it about ___ that gives you the feeling of red
		* Infinite regress of questions -- that is the problem -- exactly why people don't believe robots can feel

* The explanatory gap
	* philosophical
	* there seems to be no way of explaining feel in terms of physical chemical mechanisms known to man
	* example of color, no way of making the link with physiology
	* example of sensory presence,, no way of making the link with physiology
	* no common language, that's the explanatory gap
![[{ED345945-5BA0-46FE-9269-88EC00765502}.png]]
* this is a big confusion
* "it's to do with the way we're thinking that's gone wrong"
* beginning of 20th century same concerns around the problem of life
	* vitalists who thought that life was something special that was imbued into organic systems by a so-called ela vital or vital system 
		* wrong
		* life is not the kind of thing generated by certain organic systems
* "life is simply a word that describes the way certain systems interact with their environment"
	* we can apply this observation to other things:
	* "let's imagine that the quality of the feel is just a word, a word that describes the way we interact with the environment"
![[{921913CA-8883-4F5C-BF66-B007467BC333}.png]]
* analogy: "consider a sponge, you feel a sponge, it's soft. Where is the softness of the sponge generated? That's a stupid question. Softness is not generated at all. Softness is a word that describes how soft things behave when you press on them they squish. Softness is a sensory motor law. It's a law that describes the relation between your actions and the sensory input."
	* this makes sense w/ softness but can it be extended to all sensations?
		* to red
		* to pain
		* to taste of onion
		* **that is the bet of sensory motor theory**
		* **probably include this analogy in deliverables**
* How do you explain the fact that pure red is not created by activation of the red green channel in the red direction but requires a bit of yellow? Can we explain that using the sensory motor approach? YES WE CAN!

* But before that must think about redness and color in general
	* not in terms of activation of neural networks
	* but in terms of things we do
		* seems odd - look at a light, nothing you do to see the redness of the light
		* think not in terms of lights
		* think in terms of surfaces
			* take a red piece of paper move it around under different lights
				* light coming into your eye depends on the way the surface is being illuminated
					* if illuminated by yellow sunlight then the light coming to the eye will be more yellowish
					* if illuminated by blue skylight the light will be more bluish
					* redness is NOT the light coming into your eye
						* when you look at a red surface the light coming into your eye is NOT red
						* if only light in a room is a blue and there's a red surface, only light you see is blue yet you still see a red surface
* What is red?
	* Red is a law that describes how surfaces change the incoming light
		* What is absorbed?
		* What is reflected?
		* That law is what describes color and characterizes color
![[{FF5193DE-091C-4508-B073-50ABC8104FC1}.png]]
* red is the way red things change the light
* NOT the color of incoming light
* Mathematical model of this sensory motor approach to color:
	* turns out to be very easy
	* color is sensed by LMS cones
		* incoming light corresponds to a point in the LMS space, reflected light corresponds to another point in the LMS space
	* a color is a law that describes how incoming light in the LMS space is transformed to outgoing in the LMS space
		* can be very accurately described as a 3x3 matrix
			* consequence of the linearity of the physics of the situation
	* using DB of reflectances of surfaces can calculate 3x3 matrix of each of those surfaces
	* calculated matrices for all the mentioned surfaces
		* among all those matrices there were some that had the property of being singular
			* a singular matrix has a property that will take a point in a three dimensional space and project it down into a lower dimensional subspace
			* a singular matrix is a simpler law than usual

graph of singularity for each of the surfaces that we have in the ground plane
* some of the surfaces have the property that they're highly singular
	* **those surfaces are exactly the red, yellow, green, and blue surfaces**
		* interesting because we know color after all is a symmetrical thing 
			* nothing in the wavelengths of light coming in to single out particular colors
		* All know there are primary colors, why?
			* electromagnetic spectrum doesn't have an asymmetry that suggests such a feat
			* but singularity index does!
				* due to the way the brain interacts with surfaces
![[{F4FCECA8-E7A0-4509-AE0F-C73A10832628}.png]]
* 1970s two anthropologists Berlin and Kay went around the world asking people if they had names for these chips of color, went through more than 100 non-industrial cultures throughout the world
	* some surfaces people had names for, others people did not
	* surface people had the highest chance of giving a name to - red
		* then yellow, green, and blue
		* **exactly the same surfaces as predicted by the sensory motor theory**
			* "incredible victory for philosophy because a simple philosophical idea has made an empirical prediction and has confirmed through the anthropological data that simple laws of interaction with colors are those that people will retain when they give names to surfaces"
![[{29CA3B69-7448-438D-8BC7-BED7D98F7814}.png]]
* two graphs correspond almost exactly, within one chip  

![[{20B69758-3690-4C50-B429-9451050895A9}.png]]
* psychophysical data of what people consider to be unique colors
* y-axis has equilibrium of blue-yellow channel
* x-axis has equilibrium of red-green channel
* notice how the unique hues all take in a bit of another color
	* contrasts w/ initial prediction that the unique hue consists of only 1 color
* black lines are the predictions of the sensory motor theory
	* not trained on the data but fits it very well
		* another victory for philosophy

### sensory presence

* sensory presence in taste of onion, red, sound of bell
* not in thoughts or autonomic functions in the nervous system
* in sensory motor theory must explain in terms of sensory motor laws of interaction with the world
* for our 5 classical senses sensory motor theory has three laws
	* bodiliness
	* insubordinateness
	* grabbiness
		* sensory channels can incontrovertibly capture attention
			* ex: if kevin makes a big noise, your attention will be immediately attracted to the noise
			* ex: flash of light
			* ex: pungent smell

* HE GAVE AN EXAMPLE BUT THE SLIDES WERE BLURRY AGGHHHH
	* Note for future self: may look back at time stamp 22:50 and search for the slides to get the example
		* the example was that he showed a picture slowly changing (so slowly that it didn't grab our attention so we thought it was staying the same, he goes back and then suddenly you realize that about a 1/3 of the image has changed)
			* would be really nice if I had this as it's a good public experiment and would be a nice demo for the class
* example of change blindness
* change blindness shows the importance of grabbiness in creating the impression of seeing
* we don't see everything around us
	* seeing is a sort of illusion
	* maintained by the grabbiness of the visual system
	* which gives us the feeling of visual presence
	* visual presence is partly due to the grabbiness that occurs when we have sudden changes that attract our attention

* not enough time to go into sensory substitution and the rubber hand illusion

![[{3630C3DF-793A-4DFA-8B0A-3CB8EF8B0E9C}.png]]
* How does the brain eventually realize it is attached to a body? And that the body is immersed in space? And that space has the properties that it has (three dimensions, etc.)?
	* Kevin believes the answer lies in sensory motor contingencies 
		* he worked w/ Alexandra Tarakov on this 
		* Answer: coincidence detection
			* we have an algorithm that studies the sensory motor relations (between input and output) the agent (animal or robot) makes random actions, sometimes the environment moves, 
				* environment can either make a
					* non-rigid deformation or
					* rigid translation
			* registers cases where sensory input is the same
				* then makes a map b/t corresponding values in the motor output 
				* creates a function phi
					* a map from proprioceptive space to proprioceptive space
						* motor space to motor space
			*  created an agent in a 2D environment w/ light sources (these sources are completely arbitrarily and could be anything)
				* first test: can agent discriminate its own motion from environmental changes
				* second test: notion of path
				* third test: notion of displacement
				* "there can be no notion of space unless the agent can act"
