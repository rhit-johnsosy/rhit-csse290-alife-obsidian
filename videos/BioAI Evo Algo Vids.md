biological simulations used as inspiration

Certain systems become stronger by being perturbed
* most living systems have this characteristic

Somehow nature has taken advantage of emergence
* Can we capture that in a computer system?

What characteristics allow for emergence in nature?

* super bacteria, reason why you shouldn't stop taking prescribed medication a day early to fight off a disease, as the remaining bacteria will be the strongest

A shape of a molecule determines a lot of its characteristics.

If you can come up with a genetic representation and a fitness function for a problem, you can make an evolutionary algorithm for it, allowing for many applications.

Having domain knowledge is important, so you can not only verify the results but understand what parameters are important.

You can use a discrete value to approximate a real value.

* I was not expecting to see CAD in this project
* Interesting to think about how genetic algorithms could be used to design physical things

If you know the pressure in the wings is going to be in some range, initialize it in that value. This applies to other domain knowledge applications of genetic algorithms.

Artificial selection can happen when we talk about breeding. This applies to dogs. The process of going from wild dogs to domesticated dogs is actually really fast.

* best individual moves onto new generation
* you can pick the tournament size, larger the size more pressure

* we can clone Einstein's in artificial simulations
	* This is an example of elitism

* with trees, what you want to do you want to do cross-over between them. Pick a sub-branch from each of them and then replace.
