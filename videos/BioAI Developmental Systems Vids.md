* How do we do this?

* Humans have ~23,000 genes
	* A lot less than people were predicting
	* Less than corn
	* Many of our key genes were identical to other animals
	* This was a big shock to many as we were believed to be the most sophisticated and made the assumption that that would require the most genes
	* Therefore, there had to be something beyond genes and mutations that made humans different than the rest
* "The embryo is where the action is in terms of animal diversity. It is the platform diversity"
* "It's not the genes you have but how you use them that generates the great diversity of the animal kingdom." Sean B. Carroll

* Can see exact same genes between fruit fly and mouse

* Precambrian explosion - huge explosion for biodiversity
	* Lot of raw materials before that
	* Used and re-used in many ways
* Hox genes are present in all types of organisms that exist today and those that are extinct

* Allows us to have a very compact encoding
	* Making it easier to search the evolutionary space
* Symmetric and modular structures can be easily defined
	* Don't have to spend time re-defining the cell
