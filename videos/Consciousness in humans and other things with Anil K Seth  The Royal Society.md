* level - difference b/t awake and aware and being unconscious
	* How conscious are you?
* content - when you are conscious you are conscious of something (sight, smell, emotions, beliefs, etc.)
* self - specific experience of being you or being me
	* most popular dimension

"our eyes open our brains to the visual world but the photoreceptors in our retinas are only sensitive to a tiny slice of electromagnetic spectrum"
within the color spectrum our "receptors are just sensitive to three wavelengths of light" (red, green, blue)
the wavelengths aren't actually fully red, green, or blue. Additionally, our brain creates millions of colors using just these three wavelengths and by doing so are seeing more than what is actually there and at the same less of what is actually there (this principle is applied to everything)
