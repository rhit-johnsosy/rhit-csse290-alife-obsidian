Part 1 - What Physics Can Teach Us About Life

Entropy vs. Life
* Schrodinger - What Is Life?
	* Predicted DNA ~10 years before its discovery
	* Famous physicist but realized what he was studying could be applied to life

Computation: Turing Machines
* Same mathematical concept that Turing developed is still how we mostly think about "computation" today.
* The original computing machine by Turing
	* Many of the concepts used in Turing's machines are still used in computation and computers today

Dynamical Systems
* Ways to mathematically model and understand how systems behave over time.

Cellular Automata
* Can take varying forms and can be used to model things (bouncing particles)
* Each cell's next state is determined by some set of neighbor states
* Not necessary "cells" like living ones (although sometimes they are treated as such)
* Conway's Game of Life
	* Uses a simple set of rules to decide whether a cell is on or off
	* Based on the Moore's neighborhood:
		* If alive (1 - black)
			* survives with 2 or 3 live neighbors
		* If dead (0 - dead)
			* becomes alive with exactly 3 live neighbors

Information Theory
* Claude E. Shannon 
	* Rare that a single individual forms an entire field like this
* Theory of communication
	* Understanding how we send information to one another
* Endless applications

Part 2 - Intro to Information Theory

Information theory is based off T/F with each node representing some sort of question that leads you to a certain outcome.

Using information theory, you can compress images by encoding them to store and decoding them to open.

Max entropy achieved when equilibrium is reached:

Maxwell's demon is a thought experiment where equilibrium is never reached:
