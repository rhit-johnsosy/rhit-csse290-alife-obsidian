	* non-living to living matter
* Theoretical physics background bias
* Works with NASA on life detection on other worlds
* Predict features on the origins of life
* We know how to build simple molecular building blocks of life in a laboratory
* Don't know how to go from simple molecules to cellular life
* "How does evolution happen before evolution?" 2:04
* "One can best feel in dealing with living systems how primitive physics still is." Einstein

When I'm confronted with problems of understanding fundamentally what life is I always go back to this quote.

* This is just to give an idea of how big chemical space is
* Taxol is "not a very complex molecule" 8:59 yet it has all these possibilities to fill 1.5 universes 

Why does Taxol or any other chemical compound or thing exist, while other potential combinations do not?

* Biology seems to have slightly different rules than what Newtonian physics alluded to

* Too much research focused on making singular molecules since we kind of predesign the output
* "We should do a blind exploration of chemical space." 8:02
	* We actually have the technologies coming online to do that.
* Key contributors Lee Cronin and contributors at the University of Glasgow
* Lee is the one who really started work on Assembly Theory
	* Was trying to solve the problem of "If I had a robot that was exploring chemical mixtures in a lab, how would I know that they became alive?"
* "Sort of vision we have is to make a very large-scale experiment that would explore lots of different chemical mixtures and be able to observe the evolution of life forms before we had an evolutionary architecture that we would recognize with a genetic material." 8:25

* First slide formally introducing Assembly Theory
* "If you're building up complexity, or you're trying to build up molecules, and you have no constraints and no selection what happens in prebiotic chemistry experiments is you get tar, because without selection you get a combinatorial explosion of possibilities and you don't get an abundance of any particular configuration." 9:00
* What we're interested in studying transition to life is how do you get high-complexity molecules in high abundance? How do you actually produce them reliably?
* Assembly Theory unifies two dichotomous views that Darwin was pointing out in his work.
	* Idea that we have a production time - a reliable set of laws that can describe them (population genetics, etc.)
	* Novelty generation - where does these new conditions and laws come from?

* If you start from elementary building blocks like bonds you can make a structure that can build other structures.
	* Characterize this building process using the Assembly Index
	* Another important part of this theory that is measurable is the idea of Copy Number
		* How many of the object have you observed?

* "The informational graph that produces adenosine as an object in the theory, it is actually the feature in the theory that's physical because it's the one we measure in the lab." 12:44
	* "You think about physical molecules as computational objects." 13:04
* Reason why this is significant
	* Lose sight in the history of physics that things like mass and electric charge and all these variables that we think as very physical had to be invented for the theory that they were developed for based on the kind of measurements that we could take at the time.
		* We always start with a measurement and we build an abstraction from the measurement and then we're able to form wise laws that inform those kind of measurements.
			* In Assembly Theory this feature, this space is measurable.
* We think most of evolutionary history is predictive
* We do use the structure of this space to build phylogenetic trees of metabolism (paper is not out, will be out soon)

* Measurement system
	* Won't present results for NMR and infrared
* Paper from Lee's lab that you can measure molecular assembly index with three different modalities of measuring devices and probably you can do it with ramen too but it just hasn't been validated yet
* If you have this kind of step-wise procedure of making a molecule and you do it by this minimal path that structure actually correlates with the fragmentation pattern in a mass spec and so there's a direct correspondence between the assembly structure of the graph and what we get in the mass spec and you can also do it in NMR and IR
	* Couple years ago, had this paper out in Nature Communications that basically did this for a whole bunch of non-living and living samples and confirm that there's this sort of selectivity phase transition actually happens in chemical space of living and non-living things
	* Even with blinded samples from NASA we were able to show that we don't see any molecules above a sort of critical threshold (happens to be 15 for the samples we observed, might not universally be 15)
		* Walker's lab is trying to generalize the theory to things beyond molecules
* If we understand what happens at that sort of chemical complexity (the phase transition), that life is the only that can produce something larger than it we can have new mathematical frameworks for approaching the origin life problem in a rigorous way

* Conceptualization of the assembly space
	* Assembly Universe - no constraints - i.e. the taxol example
	* Assembly Possible - add physical constraints on what can exist
	* Assembly Contingent - the things we expect to observe in evolution
		* these things can only be built up by this recursive use of parts that have already been built
* Conjecture that we have to pass that phase transformation line you have to have a historically contingent pathway
	* History of an object is really fundamental to how evolution can even produce them
* Use of selection in assembly theory
	* Mean it in a really constructive sense like the universe is actually constructing the possibility space as it goes on a planet and this is the process we call evolution
	* **Selection is NOT just a passive filter we've traditionally thought about but it's actually constructed by objects constraining other objects to be able to allow certain things to exist and not others**


* "I think what Assembly Theory is offering is a way about how you could actually have some symmetry breaking in the sort of historical contingency of building up these parts of molecules that allows constraints to be built up over time and to describe this transition"

* Fundamentally the problem she is interested in: "if we have an unconstrained chemical reaction system we get a combinatorial explosion and undirected exploration of the space and something happens at the origin of life so that we get this sort of directed construction in a particular direction of increasing complexity."
* "something that I think a lot of us in biology aren't accustomed to thinking is we think the origin of life was an event that happened in the past but this physics is actually really general and should happen in any combinatorial space that's where memory is necessary to produce particular objects"
	* Ex: structure of human languages, reuse a lot of parts of the language
* There is some sort of phase transition that happens in any random combinatorial space where the structure actually has to be above the complexity threshold.
	* This process of origin of life might be much more general

* The things that we define as fundamental are actually historically contingent they're like a social feature of the evolution of the progress of science 
	* Ex: used to call atoms because we once thought they were indivisible but later realized they were made of neutrons, protons, and electrons
	* Ex: string theory is currently thought to be the best candidate of a new fundamental theory but we don't accept it yet because we don't have the technology to actually resolve features at that scale
* "A lot of our ability to understand the world around us is contingent on co-evolving the technology with the theories and I think this is critically important when we're talking about the nature of life because life is in front of us and all around us and we feel like we understand it but we might not have the right sort of resolution or measurement to really resolve the features that are the ones that are most important for this sort of more universal view of what life is and what it's doing."

"if you actually do introduce molecules and you subject them to different environments you don't reproduce the exact same results every time but you do kind of end up in the same region of chemical space"

* looking for goal-directed behavior in the direction or emergence of agency in oil droplets
	* How much of the behavior is selected?
	* Can you actually detect early signatures of selection in these systems?
